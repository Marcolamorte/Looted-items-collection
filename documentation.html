            <h2 id="personalization-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p id="introduction_par">
                The <strong>LOOTED ITEMS COLLECTION</strong> was born with the aim of bringing together, for the first time, some of the world’s most iconic artefacts, linked by a dark history of colonialism and looting. As we move through time and space, this virtual experience shows the users how these treasures were created, what they meant to their original cultures, and the stories behind their removal during periods of conflict and colonial expansion. Each item on this tour offers a glimpse into the artistic, spiritual, and political life of civilizations long past, while also raising important questions about cultural heritage and restitution today. Whether the visitor is looking for a quick overview, more detailed context, or an in-depth analysis, this tour adapts to his preferences. 
                The main purpose of the project is the creation of a platform which could work as an added value for a visit in the physical context as much as a complete virtual museum experience. The focus is all around the user which can decide to move inside the collection choosing the characteristics more compliant to make his needs. A personalized tour can be created by selecting and combining different sets of variables. The final result is a tour entirely created around the visitor objectives and needs.
            </p>
            <h2 id="personalization-title">Web Design Reference and Prototype</h2>
            <h2 id="personalization-title">Visual Identity</h3>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/refs/heads/main/visual%20identity.svg" alt="font-example-img">
            <p>
                <br>We designed the visual identity for this project with a focus on creating a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing interface based on the golden ratio. The process involved the following steps:<br><br>

    Concept Development: We drew inspiration from classical Greek architecture, as reflected in the Parthenon-themed background images (e.g., partenone1.svg). This concept guided the overall design direction.<br><br>
    Color Palette: We defined a cohesive color scheme using CSS variables:<br>
        Primary Color: #B7B5E4<br>
        Secondary Color: #847979<br>
        Background Color: #0C0C0F<br>
        Accent Colors: #BBC2E2 and #CFCCD6<br><br>
    These colors ensure consistency and flexibility across the design.<br><br>
    Typography: We implemented a custom font, Karrik, using the @font-face rule. This font gives our design a unique character and complements the theme.<br><br>
    Layout Structure: Sections were strategically planned with heights like 100vh or 120vh to maintain a balanced layout. This approach ensures that content is well-organized and visually appealing.<br><br>
    Responsive Design: Media queries were utilized to adapt the design for various screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="personalization-title">Design System Using CSS Variables</h2>
<p>We built a scalable design system leveraging CSS variables, with proportions derived from the golden ratio (1.6181.618). This system ensures visual harmony and simplifies adjustments across typography, spacing, and layout.<br>
    <h2 id="personalization-title">Key Variables</h2>
    <pre>--golden-ratio: 1.618;
        --base-font-size: 16px;
        --base-line-height: 1.5;
        --base-spacing: 1rem;
        </pre>

        <h2 id="personalization-title">Typography Scaling</h2>
        <pre>--spacing-small: calc(var(--base-spacing) / var(--golden-ratio));
            --spacing-large: calc(var(--base-spacing) * var(--golden-ratio));
            </pre>

            <p>By defining relationships between base values (e.g., font size, spacing), we ensured that all components scale proportionally. Adjusting any base variable automatically updates related elements throughout the design.</p>

            <h2 id="personalization-title">Figma Prototype</h2>
            <p>You can view the whole Figma prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/q36Ndmq8i0unoqVYXBwCAz/stolenarchive?node-id=8-2&t=YYGfzPMyks7L9Qmc-1">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Narrative 1:</strong> Timeline</h3>
                    <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                        <strong>Focus:</strong> Historical and artistic value of the items<br><br>
                        <strong>Description:</strong>
                        Understanding the legacy of colonial looting and the cultural loss that  accompanied it requires more than just looking at individual artefacts. When we arrange these looted items in chronological order, we uncover a broader, more complex story. One that shows the steady unfolding of imperial expansion, cultural encounters, and the lasting impact on societies around the world. This narrative was carefully constructed to guide the visitor through the timeline of CC events. Each artefact represents a moment in history when conflict, conquest, and imperial ambition collided with the cultural heritage of nations. By following this path, it will be possible to see how the forces of colonialism evolved over time, how different parts of the world were affected, and how these artefacts became symbols of both loss and resilience.
                        From the oldest looted treasures to more recent historical conflicts, this journey highlights the changing dynamics of power and resistance, showing that the story of these items is also the story of the people and nations that continue to fight for their rightful return.<br><br></p>

                        <h3><strong>Narrative 2:</strong> Colonial Conquests and Cultural Loss</h3>
                        <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Social and political consequences of colonialism and the looting process.<br><br>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> 
                        Colonialism profoundly altered the course of global history, not only through the conquest of territories but also through the systematic looting of cultural and historical treasures. This narrative delves into the darker legacy of colonialism, where artifacts, sacred objects, and symbols of national identity were forcibly removed from their homelands, stripping cultures of their heritage. The looted artifacts on display today serve as reminders of these violent encounters. This journey traces the stories behind the theft, the motivations of colonial powers, and the enduring impact on the communities who lost their cultural heritage. As we explore each artifact, we reflect on the ways colonial conquests shaped cultural identities and the ongoing debates surrounding restitution.<br><br>
                     </p>
                     
                     <h3><strong>Narrative 3:</strong> Geo tour</h3>
                     <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Through the analysis of these items geographical collocation focus on the historical events related to each one of them.<br><br>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                        The GEO LOOTING TOUR invites visitors to explore the complex and often painful history of colonialism through the lens of cultural artifacts taken from their countries of origin. Each section highlights a specific continent, illuminating the stories behind the looted items that embody the rich cultural heritages of diverse societies. By understanding the historical context in which these treasures were appropriated, visitors can appreciate the significance of repatriation efforts and the ongoing conversations surrounding cultural ownership. As we journey through Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas, we will uncover how colonial powers, motivated by curiosity, conquest, and economic gain, systematically stripped cultures of their historical artifacts, leaving lasting scars on the nations and communities affected.<br><br>

            <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                The tour selection is only the first variable in the visitor's tour personalization process. The looted items collection features a complex system of texts related to each item which adapt according to user decisions. Beyond tour selection, visitors can modify COMPLEXITY and LENGTH throughout their experience. Both of these variables move along a system of three different levels. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="tours-des">
                <h3><strong>Complexity Levels</strong></h3>
                <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    <strong>Fun:</strong> Simple and engaging language, emphasizing fun or key ideas. The use of technical terms is avoided but without compromising the informative and educational purpose of the experience. Ideal for a young audience, typically schools.<br><br>
                    <strong>Basic:</strong> Expands with more context and specific information but still light in tone and easily understandable even without particular previous knowledge. Thought for visitors interested in the subject but without a related specific education.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Expert:</strong> Goes into historical details, source-based, with references to specific events, debates, or related scholarship.Provide texts ideal for academics or amateurs expert in the subject. A level of tour which can help these types of figures in their studies and maybe additionally enrich their knowledge.</p>

                <h3><strong>Length Options</strong></h3>
                <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    <strong>Short:</strong> General context, concise but informative.<br><br>
                    <strong>Medium:</strong> Enhanced details and context, balanced presentation.<br><br>
                    <strong>Long:</strong> Comprehensive narrative including dates, events, and implications.<br><br>
                    By using and combining these variables texts change in order to reflect different lengths, competence levels, and tones. This structure is entirely controlled by the user by using special buttons which incorporate various commands like Tell me more, Tell me less, This text is too simple, This text is too difficult, or make the text more fun and enjoyable. Essentially the grid that forms at the end of the process is designed to accommodate diverse visitor types such as young audiences, generic adults, and scholars, and can easily be adapted for personalized use in the site.

                <p>
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Organize a class museum visit<br>
                    <strong>Recomendation:</strong> Probably it would be better for this user to use a tour with high length and middle or high level of complexity in order to prepare herself. Later, at the moment of the actual visit, a short tour with complexity of level “fun” would be ideal to maintain the young visitors attention and create an informative and not boring visit of the collection.

                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Brief 30-minute visit<br>
                    <strong>Recomendation:</strong> Given the short time available it would be useful to choose for short or medium texts maintaining, although, a basic or high level of complexity. In this way the text, even being short, can enrich its informative importance.

                <p>
                    The items of the collection have been selected after an in depth research. All of them have in common the fact that they have been looted from their original sites. A major concern for us was to use items from all over the world and from different epochs in order to demonstrate how colonization and looting are processes which acted by many different forms in time and space.

                <h2> Object page Visualization</h2>
                <h3>Object page description and working logic</h3>
                <p id="object-des-p-1">
                    The object page is where the choices done previously by the user in the personalization tour unfold. Here there are the tree tours:<strong> Timeline Tour</strong>, <strong>Colonial Conquest Tour</strong>, and <strong>Geo Tour</strong>. In the timeline tour the objects are presented according to a chronological order (from the oldest to the newest); in the colonial conquest tour they are disposed in an alphabetical order depending on their colonial conquest period; while in the Geo Tour they follow an alphabetical order as well according to their country of origin, which also follows an alphabetical order.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-2">
                    Each tour starts with an image showing the object and with a <strong>text description</strong> immediately below. Depending on the previous choices, the initial text can be of different <strong>lengths</strong> and <strong>difficulties</strong> (ex: it can be short but complex or long but easy), and with the <strong>more/less</strong> buttons it is possible to adjust these two parameters according to one’s information needs. Above the image there are the buttons of the three tours so clicking on one of them is always possible to change tour and start from the beginning. It is also possible to start directly from the timeline tour by clicking on the “Start Tour” on the top right in the navbar and this in particular can be done in every page.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-3">
                    The object’s images, the text and their length and complexity are all managed thanks to a JavaScript code compose by different functions that deal with the fetch and display of the item’s images and texts according to a predefined order. All the functions are saved in the <i>object-page.js</i> file. 
                    <br>
                    In this file there is first a <strong>getQueryParams()</strong> function that takes the query parameters from the current object page URL (e.g.<strong>?tour=Timeline%20Tour&length=short
                        &complexity=fun</strong>) and it extracts the selected <strong>tour name</strong> (<i>timeline</i>, <i>colonial conquest tour </i> and <i>geo tour</i>), the preferred <strong>text length</strong> (<i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>, <i>long</i>), and <strong>text complexity</strong> (<i>fun</i>, <i>basic</i>, <i>expert</i>). This function actually exists for a potential use case. It is designed to extract parameters from the URL, which could be used to dynamically load content based on URL-based selections instead of relying solely on <i>localStorage</i>, so if the <i>localStorage</i> gets cleared, but the URL contains parameters, <strong>getQueryParams()</strong> could still provide content.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-4">
                    The next step is managed by the <strong>getItemsFromLocalStorage()</strong> function that access to the items data stored in the the <i>localStorage</i>. This is useful for checking if the items data exist: if it is not the case then the function returns <i>null</i>, otherwise it converts the Json string items data into a <strong>Javascript object</strong> and return it. This function is set as a global function by this line of code: <strong>window.getItemsFromLocalStorage = getItemsFromLocalStorage</strong>; this means that it can be used anywhere within the code. <br>
                    But the real logic of the entire JavaScript file starts from the subsequent <strong>loadTourContent()</strong> function that retrieves the data stored in the browser’s <i>localStorage</i> under the key <i>tourData</i>. If no data is found, it returns <i>null</i>. The data in <i>tourData</i> key it has been saved previously in the <i>localStorage</i> and it contains all the choices made by the user in the personalize tour page. This means that there is another Javascript code (in our case the <i>personalization.js</i> file) who stores these choices in a <i>const tourData</i> and then save them using something like this: <strong>localStorage.setItem('tourData', JSON.stringify(tourData))</strong>. This function saves the data in the key <i>tourData</i> in a Json string format.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-5">
                    More specifically, in the <i>personalization.js</i> file there is the <strong>startTour()</strong> function that creates the <i>const tourData</i> with the user’s choices and save them in the <i>localStorage</i>. This function has been declared as global with the <strong>window.startTour = startTour</strong>, because it can be triggered outside the <i>personalization.js</i> file, for example just clicking the start button defined in the personalization_tour.html file  and then it can redirects to the object-page.html with the user’s choices stored in the browser <i>localStorage</i>.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-6">
                    After being redirected to the object-page the <strong>loadTourContent</strong> function, as already mentioned, retrieves in the <i>tourData</i> key the choices saved in the <i>localStorage</i> in this way: <strong>const tourData = localStorage.getItem('tourData')</strong>. This retrieves the info contained in the <i>tourData</i> key saved as a string in the <i>localStorage</i>, then with the <strong>const { tourName, length, complexity } = JSON.parse(tourData)</strong>; the string is parsed and converted into an object so it is possible to extract values and assign them to the variables <i>tourName</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>complexity</i> to be used later. 
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-7">
                    Then the <strong>loadTourContent</strong> function retrieves the content related to the variables  <i>tourName</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>complexity</i> checking in a predefined dataset saved already inside the <i>object-page.js</i> file and accessible with the <i>const data</i> variable. This datased contains all the information to be shown on the object page. The title, the object images, the text with their complexity and length, the metadata information (Rdf graph) and the maps for the location of the object in the museum and in the world (with the original position and the actual position).
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-8">
                    To show properly the objects a display function has been implemented which takes as parameters the length, the complexity and the index of the object to be displayed. Using something like this <strong>const itemId = items[index]</strong> and <strong>const itemData = texts[itemId]</strong> it is possible to retrieve the position of the item and its content in the dataset and then update dynamically with a <strong>document.getElementById()</strong> function each element of the object-page (title object, images, metadata, maps).
                    For the object page navigation menu there is a dedicated code section where <strong>document.getElementById('prev').
                    addEventListener</strong> and <strong>document.getElementById('next').add
                    EventListener</strong> deals with the scrolling from the previous to the next object and viceversa, while <strong>document.getElementById('length-less/length-more').
                    addEventListener</strong> in combination with <strong>changeLength('less')
                    /changeLength('more')</strong> and <strong>changeComplexity('less')/
                    changeComplexity('more')</strong> functions manage the increase/decrease of text’s length/complexity of the current object.
                </p>
                <p id="object-des-p-9">
                    In the <strong>Museum Localization</strong> and <strong>Geolocalization</strong> section there are maps for giving more information to the user about the locations of the object. The Museum Map shows the museum room where the object is placed, accompanied by a simple textual description of the room number; the second maps showing the original location and actual location in the world of the current displayed object. As well in this case there is a text simply explaining the previous and present location of the object.
                    <br>
                    Both Museum and Geolocalization Map have been inserted in the predefined dataset containing all the objects info and they are updated dynamically with a <strong>document.getElementById()</strong> function. The same goes for the textual references under the maps.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="metadata-des">
            <h3>Metadata section</h3>
            <p id="metadata_intro_p-1">
            The last section of the Object page is dedicated to the metadata. This section called <i>metadata-container</i> is composed by two parts(<i>metadata-content</i>): the first one contains the Image of a <strong>Rdf Graph</strong> and a short text to guide the user to a better visualization of the graph itself; the second one is dedicated to a html table enriched with <strong>Dublin core Metadata elements</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_intro_p-2">
            Essentially, to guarantee a precise and detailed metadata representation for each item, it was decided to use the Dublin Core metadata elements as a vocabulary for a general description. Moreover, for a better understanding of the cultural and historical background as well as the item’s movement from one place to another, it was adopted the CIDOC CRM conceptual model in combination with other ontologies/models (such as DBpedia), and then created a RDF Graph to provide a complete visual representation.
            </p>
            <h3> Metadata Table</h3>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-1">
                As already mentioned, a html table containing general Dublin Core metadata elements was created for each one of the 15 items and inserted within the metadata <i>metadata-container</i> section in a div container defined as <i>metadata-content</i> using a JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-2">
                From the Dublin Core metadata were taken some of the main elements used when describing any resource, such as <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">dc:title, dc:creator, dc:subject, dc:type, dc:description, dcterms:created, dcterms:spatial</span>. The idea was to give general information about the author/s. date/place of creation, main subjects, title etc…
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-3">
                The table is composed by two columns: the one in the left contains the Dublin core elements, while the other in the right contains the corresponding values. Here is an example of the code structure of the table:
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/5118ffe0397b97d09b4c4b7f24d1951a8fe5d6aa/images/table1.png" id="table-1" alt="Table image" />
                The following image is how the table appears in the web page:
                <br>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/5118ffe0397b97d09b4c4b7f24d1951a8fe5d6aa/images/table2.png" id="table-2" alt="Table image" />
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-4">
                Each table then was uploaded on a GitHub repository and then, to be visualized correctly, the <strong> raw link </strong> of the table on the GitHub repository was inserted into a JavaScript file (<i>object-page.js</i>) as part of a variable (<i>const data</i> in the JavaScript file) containing all the information of each item to be displayed in the object-page. Below an example of how is structered the information whithin the variable.
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/5118ffe0397b97d09b4c4b7f24d1951a8fe5d6aa/images/table3.png" id="table-3" alt="Table image" />
                As it can be seen in the image above, in the <i>const data</i> variable there is a metadata section containing a key-value pair for the RDF graph elements and the html table, where for example the key is <i>“Table”</i> and the value is the <i>"raw link"</i>. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-5">
                To visualize the <strong>Table content</strong> content, it was used a JavaScript code to identify the exact point where to inject inside the div <i>metadata-content</i> of the Object page.html, and fetching it with the raw link provided in the <i>const data</i>variable. The code used for this operation was the following:
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/5118ffe0397b97d09b4c4b7f24d1951a8fe5d6aa/images/table4.png" id="table-4" alt="Table image" />
                The variable <strong> TableMetadata = document.getElementById('table-metadata')</strong> identifies the point whitin the div metadata-content where to load the table while the fetch(tableURL) uses the table url to get the table content with a http GET request and the TableMetadata.innerHTML = data, updates the TableMetadata element with the obtained content.
                <br>
                These steps are done for the tables of every item and in this way, using the javascript code it is possibile to update dinamically the content table corresponding to the right object to show.
            </p>
            <h3> Metadata RDF Graph </h3>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-intro">
                Similar to what has been done with the Html Table, <stron>a RDF Graph</stron> was created to provide a different point of view about the historical and cultural background of the object, in particular whit a focus on the places where the object was created and/or found, moved from and to by foreign forces. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-1">
                First of all, it was developed for each object a rdf file in Javascript, using <strong> CIDOC CRM conceptual model</strong> as reference, in combination with other models/vocabularies such as <strong> DBpedia, Wikidata, Geonames, XML Schema</strong> etc… On some occasion it was necessary to adopt a personalized ontology (items-ontology) created ad hoc for describing specific aspects of the item.
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-2">
                After that it was used the <strong>RDF grapher</strong> web service for parsing RDF data and visualizing it as a graph. What we got are high resolution images of the rdf graph to be put within the <i>metadata-container</i>. The image can be clicked and opened to its full width, it is possible also to zoom in/out and pan around to explore the full graph. Here an example of the image obtained:
                <img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcolamorte/Looted-items-collection/5118ffe0397b97d09b4c4b7f24d1951a8fe5d6aa/rdf_files_graphs/1_Africa_Benin_Bronzes.png" id="rdf-image" alt="rdf graph image" />
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-3">
                Below the image there is a section that helps the user to interact better with the graph using an external tool. In particular, it is possible to use the link of the rdf file hosted in the github repository and pasting it in the <i>Visualize Web page</i> section of <strong>isSemantic.net</strong>, a rdf visualizer tool, accessible through the “View on -isSemantic.net” button at the end of the section.
