            <p id="introduction_par">
                The <strong>LOOTED ITEMS COLLECTION</strong> was born with the aim of bringing together, for the first time, some of the world’s most iconic artefacts, linked by a dark history of colonialism and looting. As we move through time and space, this virtual experience shows the users how these treasures were created, what they meant to their original cultures, and the stories behind their removal during periods of conflict and colonial expansion. Each item on this tour offers a glimpse into the artistic, spiritual, and political life of civilizations long past, while also raising important questions about cultural heritage and restitution today. Whether the visitor is looking for a quick overview, more detailed context, or an in-depth analysis, this tour adapts to his preferences. 
                The main purpose of the project is the creation of a platform which could work as an added value for a visit in the physical context as much as a complete virtual museum experience. The focus is all around the user which can decide to move inside the collection choosing the characteristics more compliant to make his needs. A personalized tour can be created by selecting and combining different sets of variables. The final result is a tour entirely created around the visitor objectives and needs.

                    <h3><strong>Narrative 1:</strong> Timeline</h3>
                    <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                        <strong>Focus:</strong> Historical and artistic value of the items<br><br>
                        <strong>Description:</strong>
                        Understanding the legacy of colonial looting and the cultural loss that  accompanied it requires more than just looking at individual artefacts. When we arrange these looted items in chronological order, we uncover a broader, more complex story. One that shows the steady unfolding of imperial expansion, cultural encounters, and the lasting impact on societies around the world. This narrative was carefully constructed to guide the visitor through the timeline of CC c events. Each artefact represents a moment in history when conflict, conquest, and imperial ambition collided with the cultural heritage of nations. By following this path, it will be possible to see how the forces of colonialism evolved over time, how different parts of the world were affected, and how these artefacts became symbols of both loss and resilience.
                        From the oldest looted treasures to more recent historical conflicts, this journey highlights the changing dynamics of power and resistance, showing that the story of these items is also the story of the people and nations that continue to fight for their rightful return.<br><br></p>

                        <h3><strong>Narrative 2:</strong> Colonial Conquests and Cultural Loss</h3>
                        <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Social and political consequences of colonialism and the looting process.<br><br>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> 
                        Colonialism profoundly altered the course of global history, not only through the conquest of territories but also through the systematic looting of cultural and historical treasures. This narrative delves into the darker legacy of colonialism, where artifacts, sacred objects, and symbols of national identity were forcibly removed from their homelands, stripping cultures of their heritage. The looted artifacts on display today serve as reminders of these violent encounters. This journey traces the stories behind the theft, the motivations of colonial powers, and the enduring impact on the communities who lost their cultural heritage. As we explore each artifact, we reflect on the ways colonial conquests shaped cultural identities and the ongoing debates surrounding restitution.<br><br>

                     <h3><strong>Narrative 3:</strong> Geo tour</h3>

                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Through the analysis of these items geographical collocation focus on the historical events related to each one of them.<br><br>
                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                        The GEO LOOTING TOUR invites visitors to explore the complex and often painful history of colonialism through the lens of cultural artifacts taken from their countries of origin. Each section highlights a specific continent, illuminating the stories behind the looted items that embody the rich cultural heritages of diverse societies. By understanding the historical context in which these treasures were appropriated, visitors can appreciate the significance of repatriation efforts and the ongoing conversations surrounding cultural ownership. As we journey through Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas, we will uncover how colonial powers, motivated by curiosity, conquest, and economic gain, systematically stripped cultures of their historical artifacts, leaving lasting scars on the nations and communities affected.<br><br>

            <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                The tour selection is only the first variable in the visitor's tour personalization process. The looted item collection features a complex system of texts related to each item which adapt according to user decisions. Beyond tour selection, visitors can modify COMPLEXITY and LENGTH throughout their experience. Both of these variables move along a system of three different levels. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="tours-des">
                <h3><strong>Complexity Levels</strong></h3>
                <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    <strong>Fun:</strong> Simple and engaging language, emphasizing fun or key ideas. The use of technical terms is avoided but without compromising the informative and educational purpose of the experience. Ideal for a young audience, typically schools.<br><br>
                    <strong>Basic:</strong> Expands with more context and specific information but still light in tone and easily understandable even without particular previous knowledge. Thought for visitors interested in the subject but without a related specific education.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Expert:</strong> Goes into historical details, source-based, with references to specific events, debates, or related scholarship.Provide texts ideal for academics or amateurs expert in the subject. A level of tour which can help these types of figures in their studies and maybe additionally enrich their knowledge.</p>

                <h3><strong>Length Options</strong></h3>
                <p id="Timeline_Tour_par">
                    <strong>Short:</strong> General context, concise but informative.<br><br>
                    <strong>Medium:</strong> Enhanced details and context, balanced presentation.<br><br>
                    <strong>Long:</strong> Comprehensive narrative including dates, events, and implications.<br><br>
                    By using and combining these variables texts change in order to reflect different lengths, competence levels, and tones. This structure is entirely controlled by the user by using special buttons which incorporate various commands like Tell me more, Tell me less, This text is too simple, This text is too difficult, or make the text more fun and enjoyable. Essentially the grid that forms at the end of the process is designed to accommodate diverse visitor types such as young audiences, generic adults, and scholars, and can easily be adapted for personalized use in the site.

                <h3><strong>1. Alice (Middle School Teacher)</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Organize a class museum visit<br>
                    <strong>Recomendation:</strong> Probably it would be better for this user to use a tour with high length and middle or high level of complexity in order to prepare herself. Later, at the moment of the actual visit, a short tour with complexity of level “fun” would be ideal to maintain the young visitors attention and create an informative and not boring visit of the collection.

                    <strong>Goal:</strong> Brief 30-minute visit<br>
                    <strong>Recomendation:</strong> Given the short time available it would be useful to choose for short or medium texts maintaining, although, a basic or high level of complexity. In this way the text, even being short, can enrich its informative importance.

                <p>
                    The items of the collection have been selected after an in depth research. All of them have in common the fact that they have been looted from their original sites. A major concern for us was to use items from all over the world and from different epochs in order to demonstrate how colonization and looting are processes which acted by many different forms in time and space.

        <section class="object_page-des">
            <div id="object-visualization-des">
                <h2> Object page Visualization</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="metadata-des">
            <h3>Metadata section</h3>
            <p id="metadata_intro_p-1">
            The last section of the Object page is dedicated to the metadata. This section called <i>metadata-container</i> is composed by two parts(<i>metadata-content</i>): the first one contains the Image of a <strong>Rdf Graph</strong> and a short text to guide the user to a better visualization of the graph itself; the second one is dedicated to a html table enriched with <strong>Dublin core Metadata elements</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_intro_p-2">
            Essentially, to guarantee a precise and detailed metadata representation for each item, it was decided to use the Dublin Core metadata elements as a vocabulary for a general description. Moreover, for a better understanding of the cultural and historical background as well as the item’s movement from one place to another, it was adopted the CIDOC CRM conceptual model in combination with other ontologies/models (such as DBpedia), and then created a RDF Graph to provide a complete visual representation.
            </p>
            <h3> Metadata Table</h3>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-1">
                As already mentioned, a html table containing general Dublin Core metadata elements was created for each one of the 15 items and inserted within the metadata <i>metadata-container</i> section in a div container defined as <i>metadata-content</i> using a JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-2">
                From the Dublin Core metadata were taken some of the main elements used when describing any resource, such as <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">dc:title, dc:creator, dc:subject, dc:type, dc:description, dcterms:created, dcterms:spatial</span>. The idea was to give general information about the author/s. date/place of creation, main subjects, title etc…
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-3">
                The table is composed by two columns: the one in the left contains the Dublin core elements, while the other in the right contains the corresponding values. Here is an example of the code structure of the table:
                <img src=".\images\table1.png" id="table-1" alt="Table image" />
                The following image is how the table appears in the web page:
                <br>
                <img src=".\images\table2.png" id="table-2" alt="Table image" />
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-4">
                Each table then was uploaded on a GitHub repository and then, to be visualized correctly, the <strong> raw link </strong> of the table on the GitHub repository was inserted into a JavaScript file (<i>object-page.js</i>) as part of a variable (<i>const data</i> in the JavaScript file) containing all the information of each item to be displayed in the object-page. Below an example of how is structered the information whithin the variable.
                <img src=".\images\table3.png" id="table-3" alt="Table image" />
                As it can be seen in the image above, in the <i>const data</i> variable there is a metadata section containing a key-value pair for the RDF graph elements and the html table, where for example the key is <i>“Table”</i> and the value is the <i>"raw link"</i>. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_table_p-5">
                To visualize the <strong>Table content</strong> content, it was used a JavaScript code to identify the exact point where to inject inside the div <i>metadata-content</i> of the Object page.html, and fetching it with the raw link provided in the <i>const data</i>variable. The code used for this operation was the following:
                <img src=".\images\table4.png" id="table-4" alt="Table image" />
                The variable <strong> TableMetadata = document.getElementById('table-metadata')</strong> identifies the point whitin the div metadata-content where to load the table while the fetch(tableURL) uses the table url to get the table content with a http GET request and the TableMetadata.innerHTML = data, updates the TableMetadata element with the obtained content.
                <br>
                These steps are done for the tables of every item and in this way, using the javascript code it is possibile to update dinamically the content table corresponding to the right object to show.
            </p>
            <h3> Metadata RDF Graph </h3>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-intro">
                Similar to what has been done with the Html Table, <stron>a RDF Graph</stron> was created to provide a different point of view about the historical and cultural background of the object, in particular whit a focus on the places where the object was created and/or found, moved from and to by foreign forces. 
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-1">
                First of all, it was developed for each object a rdf file in Javascript, using <strong> CIDOC CRM conceptual model</strong> as reference, in combination with other models/vocabularies such as <strong> DBpedia, Wikidata, Geonames, XML Schema</strong> etc… On some occasion it was necessary to adopt a personalized ontology (items-ontology) created ad hoc for describing specific aspects of the item.
            </p id="metadata_rdf_graph-2">
            <p>
                After that it was used the <strong>RDF grapher</strong> web service for parsing RDF data and visualizing it as a graph. What we got are high resolution images of the rdf graph to be put within the <i>metadata-container</i>. The image can be clicked and opened to its full width, it is possible also to zoom in/out and pan around to explore the full graph. Here an example of the image obtained:
                <img src= ".\rdf_files_graphs\1_Africa_Benin_Bronzes.png" id="rdf-image" alt="rdf graph image" />
            </p>
            <p id="metadata_rdf_graph-3">
                Below the image there is a section that helps the user to interact better with the graph using an external tool. In particular, it is possible to use the link of the rdf file hosted in the github repository and pasting it in the <i>Visualize Web page</i> section of <strong>isSemantic.net</strong>, a rdf visualizer tool, accessible through the “View on -isSemantic.net” button
