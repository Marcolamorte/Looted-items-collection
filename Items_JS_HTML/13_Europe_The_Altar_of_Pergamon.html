                        and monumental structures from ancient Greece.Built during the Hellenistic period in the ancient city of Pergamon 
                        (in present-day Turkey),  the altar is considered one of the greatest achievements of Hellenistic art and architecture.
                        It is a Mythological and cultural symbol, focusing on themes of divine order, power, and victory. 
                        Its most famous feature, the Gigantomachy frieze, depicts the legendary battle between the Olympian 
                        gods and the Giants, a central myth in ancient Greek cosmology. This battle represents the triumph of
                        divine order and civilization (Gods) over chaos and barbarism (Giants).</td>
