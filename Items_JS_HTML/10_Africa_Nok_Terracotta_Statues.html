                        which flourished in what is now Nigeria between approximately 1500 BCE to 500 CE . 
                        The Nok people are known for their advanced terracotta production, particularly their intricate sculptures, 
                        which are considered some of the oldest known sculptures in sub-Saharan Africa.
                        The Nok terracotta statues likely represent a range of subjects, including humans, animals, 
                        and possibly mythical or spiritual beings, reflecting the beliefs, 
                        customs, and societal structures of the Nok culture.</td>
